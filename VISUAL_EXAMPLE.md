╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                                                ║
║  (1) APPROACH: Begin by acknowledging the patient's           ║
║  preferences respectfully. Say: "I understand you've shared   ║
║  important preferences about your care, and I want to honor   ║
║  those while providing the best treatment."                   ║
║                                                                ║
║  (2) EXPLORE: Ask questions to understand their perspective:  ║
║     - "What aspects of traditional care are most important    ║
║        to you?"                                               ║
║     - "Are there specific cultural or religious               ║
║        considerations I should know about?" (e.g., prayer     ║
║        times, fasting during Ramadan, halal medications)      ║
║     - "What concerns do you have about conventional           ║
║        treatments?"                                           ║
║     - "Have family members had positive experiences with      ║
║        any particular treatments?"                            ║
║                                                                ║
║  (3) INTEGRATE:                                               ║
║     - Check if a Muslim physician is available for            ║
║        consultation or care coordination if patient prefers   ║
║     - For medication timing: "Do you observe prayer times?    ║
║        Let's schedule medications around those."              ║
║     - Discuss complementary approaches: "Some patients        ║
║        combine physical therapy with traditional practices    ║
║        like cupping or herbal supplements. Let's discuss      ║
║        what's safe to use together."                          ║
║     - Use shared decision-making: Present options with        ║
║        benefits/risks, then ask which aligns with values      ║
║     - For pain management: Consider non-opioid options        ║
║        aligned with preference for natural approaches         ║
║        (physical therapy, acupuncture, NSAIDs)                ║
║                                                                ║
║  (4) AVOID:                                                   ║
║     - Don't dismiss traditional practices: Never say "That    ║
║        won't work" or "Only Western medicine is effective"    ║
║     - Avoid assumptions: Don't assume all Muslim patients     ║
║        have identical preferences or want to avoid all        ║
║        conventional treatments                                ║
║     - Don't appear defensive if you're not Muslim; instead,   ║
║        demonstrate cultural humility: "I want to learn what's ║
║        important to you"                                      ║
║     - Skip generic responses like "We respect all cultures";  ║
║        provide specific examples of accommodation             ║
║                                                                ║

Doctor can literally use the example phrases in quotes:
- ✅ "I understand you've shared important preferences..."

- Addresses provider concordance

### 4. **Addresses Implicit Bias**
Explicitly calls out potential pitfalls:
- "Don't dismiss traditional practices"
- "Avoid assumptions"
- "Don't appear defensive"

### 5. **Practical Considerations**
Real-world implementation details:
- Medication timing around prayers
- Availability of Muslim physician
