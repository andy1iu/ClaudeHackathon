# Enhanced Recommendation Format Guide

## Overview
This guide shows how the AI should structure detailed, actionable recommendations for the Health Equity & Patient Context section.

---

## Recommendation Structure

Each recommendation should follow this 4-part framework:

### 1. **APPROACH** 
How to open the conversation respectfully

### 2. **EXPLORE**
What questions to ask to understand the patient's perspective

### 3. **INTEGRATE**
How to incorporate their preferences into the care plan

### 4. **AVOID**
What not to do or say

---

## Example 1: Cultural Care Preferences

### Scenario
**Flag**: Patient Cultural Care Preference  
**Type**: Cultural Context  
**Patient Context**: Patient expressed preference for Muslim doctors and traditional care approach

### ❌ BAD Recommendation (Too Brief)
```
"Ensure culturally respectful communication and explore patient's understanding of traditional and Western medical approaches to treatment."
```

### ✅ GOOD Recommendation (Detailed & Actionable)
```
(1) APPROACH: Begin by acknowledging the patient's preferences with respect. You might say: "I understand you've shared some important preferences about your care. I want to make sure we honor those while providing you with the best medical treatment."

(2) EXPLORE: Ask open-ended questions to understand their perspective:
   - "Can you help me understand what aspects of traditional care are most important to you?"
   - "Are there specific practices or treatments from your cultural background that you'd like to incorporate?"
   - "What concerns, if any, do you have about Western medical approaches?"
   - "Are there any cultural or religious considerations for this treatment that I should know about?" (e.g., fasting, prayer times, dietary restrictions)

(3) INTEGRATE: 
   - If a Muslim physician is available in the practice, offer to arrange a consultation or care transfer if the patient prefers
   - For medication timing, ask: "Do you observe prayer times or fasting periods? Let's schedule medications around those if possible."
   - Explore complementary approaches: "Some patients combine conventional treatment with traditional practices like herbal supplements or dietary approaches. Let's discuss what's safe to use together."
   - Use shared decision-making: Present treatment options with clear explanations of benefits/risks, then ask which aligns with their values

(4) AVOID:
   - Don't dismiss or minimize traditional practices: Never say "That won't work" or "Only Western medicine is effective"
   - Avoid assumptions: Don't assume all Muslim patients have identical preferences or that this patient wants to avoid all conventional treatments
   - Don't appear defensive: If you're not Muslim, don't over-apologize; instead, demonstrate cultural humility and willingness to learn
   - Skip generic responses: Instead of "We respect all cultures here," provide specific examples of how you'll accommodate their needs

## Example 2: Bias Interruption for Pain

### Scenario
**Flag**: Risk of Pain Underassessment  
**Type**: Bias Interruption  
**Patient Context**: Black female patient reporting severe chronic pain; research shows this demographic's pain is often undertreated

### ❌ BAD Recommendation (Too Brief)
```
"Ensure pain is assessed using a validated scale and treated appropriately."
```

### ✅ GOOD Recommendation (Detailed & Actionable)
```
(1) APPROACH: Take a proactive, believing stance from the start. Say: "I want to make sure we take your pain seriously and get it under control. Pain is what you say it is, and I'm here to help."

(2) EXPLORE: Use detailed assessment questions:
   - "On a scale of 0-10, how would you rate your pain right now? At its worst? At its best?"
   - "What words would you use to describe this pain?" (Document patient's exact words)
   - "What does this pain prevent you from doing that you wish you could do?"
   - "What have you tried so far, and what's worked or not worked?"
   - "How is this pain affecting your sleep, work, relationships, mental health?"

(3) INTEGRATE: 
   - Document pain using validated tools (e.g., Brief Pain Inventory, PEG scale)
   - Set a pain treatment goal with the patient: "What level of pain would be acceptable to you?"
   - Create a multimodal pain plan: Consider pharmacologic AND non-pharmacologic options (physical therapy, psychology referral for CBT, nerve blocks if indicated)
   - Schedule early follow-up: "Let's check in again in [timeframe] to make sure the treatment is working"
   - Use teach-back: "Can you tell me how you'll use this medication?" to ensure understanding without being condescending

(4) AVOID:
   - Don't question the patient's report: Avoid "Are you sure it's that bad?" or "Maybe it's just stress"
   - Resist implicit bias: Be aware that studies show providers often perceive Black patients as exaggerating pain or seeking drugs
   - Don't undertreate: If opioids are indicated, don't withhold them due to bias; discuss risks/benefits respectfully
   - Avoid dismissive body language: Maintain eye contact, lean forward, take notes to show you're taking their concerns seriously
   - Don't blame the patient: Skip phrases like "If you just lost weight..." or "This is probably because you're not exercising"
```

## Example 3: Population Health Risk

### Scenario
**Flag**: Elevated Diabetes Risk in Hispanic Population  
**Type**: Population Health  
**Patient Context**: 45-year-old Hispanic male with family history of diabetes, presenting with fatigue

### ❌ BAD Recommendation (Too Brief)
```
"Screen for diabetes given population risk factors."
```

### ✅ GOOD Recommendation (Detailed & Actionable)
```
(1) APPROACH: Frame screening as preventive care, not an assumption. Say: "Based on your family history and symptoms, I'd like to check your blood sugar. Diabetes is something we can catch early and manage well, and I want to make sure we're staying ahead of any issues."

(2) EXPLORE: Understand the patient's full context:
   - "Do you have family members with diabetes? What has their experience been like?"
   - "What do you know about diabetes prevention and management?"
   - "Are there cultural foods or eating patterns that are important to you?" (Don't assume a Hispanic patient eats a stereotypical diet)
   - "What would feel realistic for you in terms of lifestyle changes if we needed to make any?"
   - "Do you have any concerns about diabetes or testing?"

(3) INTEGRATE:
   - Order appropriate screening: HbA1c, fasting glucose, or OGTT based on clinical picture
   - If prediabetic or diabetic, refer to diabetes education that offers culturally tailored programs if available
   - Discuss dietary approaches that incorporate cultural foods: "We can work with a dietitian who understands how to adapt traditional recipes in heart-healthy ways"
   - Connect to community resources: Check if there are Spanish-language diabetes support groups or community health workers
   - Address social determinants: "Do you have access to affordable fresh foods in your neighborhood?" Refer to food assistance if needed

(4) AVOID:
   - Don't make assumptions about diet: Avoid "You probably eat too many tortillas" or similar culturally insensitive comments
   - Skip the lecture: Instead of telling them everything they're doing wrong, ask what changes they feel ready to make
   - Don't ignore structural factors: If the patient lives in a food desert or works multiple jobs, acknowledge these barriers: "I know it's not always easy to find time or access to healthy options"
   - Avoid one-size-fits-all advice: Ask what has worked for their family members with diabetes before prescribing a generic plan
```

## Example 4: Previous Healthcare Trauma

### Scenario
**Flag**: History of Medical Mistrust  
**Type**: Bias Interruption  
**Patient Context**: Patient mentioned previous negative experiences with healthcare system, expressed reluctance to follow prior recommendations

### ❌ BAD Recommendation (Too Brief)
```
"Build trust through transparent communication and involve patient in decision-making."
```

### ✅ GOOD Recommendation (Detailed & Actionable)
```
(1) APPROACH: Acknowledge past harm directly. Say: "I'm sorry you've had negative experiences in the healthcare system before. I can understand why that might make it hard to trust recommendations. I want to do things differently and make sure you feel heard and respected."

(2) EXPLORE: Create space to understand their experiences:
   - "Would you be comfortable sharing what happened in those previous experiences?" (Don't pressure if they decline)
   - "What would make this experience different for you?"
   - "What do you need from me as your doctor to feel like this is a partnership?"
   - "Are there specific concerns you have about the treatment I'm recommending?"
   - "What information would help you feel confident about this plan?"

(3) INTEGRATE:
   - Use transparent communication: "Here's what I'm thinking and why. What are your thoughts?"
   - Offer choices wherever possible: "There are three approaches we could take. Let me explain each one, and we can decide together which feels right."
   - Explain the 'why': Don't just say what to do—explain the reasoning: "I'm suggesting this test because..."
   - Get explicit consent for each step: "Is it okay if I examine your [body part]?" "May I order this test?"
   - Provide written summaries: Give them notes from the visit so they can review at home
   - Make yourself available: "If you have questions after you leave, here's how to reach me"
   - Honor their pace: If they're not ready for a treatment, say: "That's okay. Let's talk about what you ARE comfortable with today."

(4) AVOID:
   - Don't gaslight previous experiences: Never say "I'm sure they were doing their best" or "That probably didn't happen"
   - Avoid defensiveness: Don't take their mistrust personally or get frustrated
   - Skip coercion: Don't use scare tactics like "You'll die if you don't do this" to pressure compliance
   - Don't rush: Even if you're busy, communicate that you have time for their concerns
   - Avoid medical jargon without explanation: Use plain language and check understanding
   - Don't make promises you can't keep: Be honest about what you can and cannot control
```

## Key Principles for ALL Recommendations

### 1. **Be Specific**
❌ "Use culturally appropriate communication"  
✅ "You might say: '[exact phrase example]'"

### 2. **Provide Example Phrases**
Include 2-3 things the doctor can literally say to the patient

### 3. **Address Both Actions and Mindset**
Talk about both what to DO and what implicit biases to be aware of

### 4. **Acknowledge Structural Barriers**
Recognize when system issues (food deserts, work schedules, insurance) are factors

### 5. **Make It Practical**
Can the doctor implement this in a real visit? If not, simplify.

### 6. **Show Cultural Humility**
Avoid assumptions, ask questions, demonstrate willingness to learn

### 7. **Include the "Don't Do This" List**
Sometimes it's most helpful to explicitly name common mistakes

## Formatting for AI Output

When generating these recommendations in the JSON, format as follows:

```json
{
  "recommendation": "(1) APPROACH: [2-3 sentences with example phrase]\n\n(2) EXPLORE: [Questions to ask with bullet points]\n\n(3) INTEGRATE: [Specific actions with bullet points]\n\n(4) AVOID: [Things not to do with bullet points]"
}
```

The `\n\n` double line breaks will be rendered in the UI for readability.

---

## Testing Checklist

After generating a recommendation, check:
- [ ] Does it include all 4 parts (APPROACH, EXPLORE, INTEGRATE, AVOID)?
- [ ] Are there at least 2 specific example phrases the doctor can use?
- [ ] Would a busy clinician find this actionable in a 15-minute visit?
- [ ] Does it avoid stereotypes and assumptions?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge potential structural barriers?
- [ ] Is it respectful to both patient and provider?
- [ ] Does it demonstrate cultural humility?
